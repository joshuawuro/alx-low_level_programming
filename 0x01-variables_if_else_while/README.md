## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

* You can find the source code [here][https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c]
* The variable `n` will store a different value everytime you will run this program
* You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`,`RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code.
https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c* The output of the program should be:
    - The number, followed by
        * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
        * if the number is 0: `is zero`
        * if the number is less than zero: `is negative`
    - followed by a new line

This program will asssign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed, Complete the source code in order to print the number stored in the variable `n`.
    * You can find the source code [here][https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c]
    * The variable `n` will store different value every time you run this program
    * You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, and `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code.
    * The output of the program should be:
        - The string `Last digit of`,followed by
        - `n`,followed by
        - the string `is`,followed by
            * if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
            * if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is zero`
            * if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
        - followed by a new line
